# TabiMap Collections

## Requirements Specification (RFC-001)

**Version:** 1.2

**Status:** Approved & Implemented

---

## 1. Purpose

Collections introduce curated groupings of destinations that exist alongside the existing Region and Prefecture hierarchy.

Collections are intended to:

* improve destination discovery
* group related destinations
* provide official and historical categorizations
* enable progress tracking

---

# 2. Design Principles

### 2.1 Minimal evolution

The data model evolves only when required by planned features. Speculative abstractions are avoided.

### 2.2 Provenance

Every collection exposes its official or historical source authority where applicable.

### 2.3 Progressive enhancement

Collections function cleanly without requiring complex backend dependencies.

# 3. Data Model

## 3.1 Collection Interface (`src/shared/data/collections-index.json`)

```ts
interface Collection {
  id: string;
  slug: string;
  name: string;
  description: string;
  category: string;
  type: "official" | "historical" | "curated";
  icon: string;
  badgeColor: string;
  sortOrder: number;
  officialSource?: string;
  sourceUrl?: string;
}
```

# 5. Pipeline Integrity Validation

`scripts/pipeline.cjs` validates at build time:

* All `collectionId` references exist in `collections-index.json`.
* Duplicate collection IDs or slugs throw errors.
* Duplicate memberships per destination throw errors.
* `confirmed=false` produces validation warnings.

---

# 6. Regional Calibration Rules

Destinations outside the core calibrated travel region use:

```text
travelEstimate.confidence = "beta"
```

The UI displays an informational notice explaining that regional travel estimates are undergoing calibration.
