# Why I built TabiMap

After moving to Japan, I realised that planning a simple trip involved opening multiple apps and websites.

I'd usually have Google Maps open for travel times, a weather forecast in another tab, train fare calculators, travel blogs and a notes app just to compare a few destinations.

There are plenty of websites showing places to visit, but very few help narrow them down based on your own situation.

I built TabiMap to simplify that process.

Instead of browsing endless lists, the app recommends destinations based on things that actually matter when planning a trip:

- Current weather
- Travel time
- Budget
- Preferred transport
- Personal interests
- Time of year

The goal isn't to replace travel guides—it's to make deciding **where to go** much easier.

# Challenges

One of the biggest challenges was balancing recommendation quality with frontend performance.

Originally, all destination data was bundled together, increasing the initial download size.

To improve performance, destination information was split into individual JSON files. The application now loads lightweight summaries first and fetches full destination details only when required.

This keeps the initial load fast while still allowing detailed destination pages.
